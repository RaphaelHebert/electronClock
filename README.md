## 👀 Overview

TODO: introduce the project and its context

## 🛫 Quick Setup

```sh

# install dependency
npm install

# develop
npm run dev
```

## 📂 Directory structure

Familiar React application structure, just with `electron` folder on the top :wink:  
_Files in this folder will be separated from your React application and built into `dist-electron`_

```tree
├── electron                                 Electron-related code
│   ├── main                                 Main-process source code
│   └── preload                              Preload-scripts source code
│
├── models                                  Connection to SQLite 3 database
│
├── public                                   Static assets
└── src                                      Renderer source code, React application
```
